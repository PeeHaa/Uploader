<h2>About</h2>
<p>FileUploader is the easiest way to set up your own private filelocker. It is a free (as in beer) open source project. It is created by <a href="https://github.com/PeeHaa" target="_blank">Pieter Hordijk</a> and the project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/PeeHaa/Uploader" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. FileUploader uses the open source <a href="https://github.com/valums/file-uploader" target="_blank">Fine Uploader</a> for the clientside uploader. The goal of the project it to enable everyone to setup a filesharing platform to curb censorship and let the information freely flow.</p>
